Snake game is a classic arcade game that was first introduced in the 1970s and gained widespread popularity in the 1990s with the introduction of mobile phones. The objective of the game is to control a snake that moves around a game board or screen, eating food and avoiding obstacles such as walls and its own tail. As the snake eats more food, it grows longer, making it more challenging to avoid obstacles and navigate the game board.

In the traditional version of the game, the snake is controlled by the player using arrow keys or other controls to direct its movement. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or its own body, and the player's score is based on the number of pieces of food the snake has eaten.

In modern versions of the game, there are often variations on the classic formula, such as different game modes, power-ups, and multiplayer options. The game is popular among players of all ages and has been adapted to many different platforms, including mobile phones, computers, and gaming consoles.

Overall, snake game is a simple but addictive game that challenges players to test their reflexes and strategic thinking skills. Its simplicity and universal appeal have made it a classic and enduring game that continues to be enjoyed by players of all ages.
